# Setup instructions (Blackboard)

To complete setting up the LTI tool in your Blackboard instance you will need to go through the [LTI tool setup instructions](README.md) to obtain the following information:

- **ltiToolAuthUri**: is the Url used by an LTI platform like Blackboard to forward to the LTI plugin tool. It's the main entrance to the tool and should be used to set authentication and redirect urls in your LTI plugin configuration.
- **ltiToolLoginUri**: is the Url used by Blackboard to allow for federated login.
- **ltiToolJwkUri**: is the Url used by Blackboard to obtain an OpenId token that is used to verify signature of incoming client requests.

Read step 5 of the [LTI tool setup instructions](README.md) for further instructions.
